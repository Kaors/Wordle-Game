# Wordle-Game
My take at the popular game

Current Ideas:
1. 5, 6, and 7 letter version of the game
2. Insane mode that does not tell you if the letter is in the right place
3. Players can add new words to word bank (reasonable words)

Shortcomings:
1. Currently useing a very limited database of words in the .txt file
2. Many repeated operations throughout the code. Could make changes that reduce the number of these repeated operations by adding new functions or hashing.
3. Difficult to visualize compared to original game even with all the information given.
